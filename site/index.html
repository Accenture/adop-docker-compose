<p>The DevOps Platform is a tools environment for continuously testing, releasing and maintaining applications. Reference code, delivery pipelines, automated testing and environments can be loaded in via the concept of <a href="https://github.com/Accenture/adop-cartridge-skeleton">Cartridges</a>.</p>
<p>The platform runs on a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/swarm/">Docker container cluster</a> so it can be stood up for evaluation purposes on just one server using local storage, or stood up in a multi-data centre cluster with distributed network storage.  It will also run anywhere that <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/binaries/">Docker runs</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the front page:</p>

<p>Once you have a stack up and running, you can log in with the username and password created upon start-up.</p>
<p>If you provisioned your stack using the start-up CLI, an example workspace containing an example project and an example cartridge will all have been pre-loaded in Jenkins:</p>

<p>Once you have explored this the next step is to create your own Workspace and Project and then load another cartridge using a 'Load Cartridge' job in the 'Cartridge Management' folder (that automatically gets created in any Project).  The cartridge <a href="https://github.com/accenture/adop-cartridge-cartridge-dev/">development cartridge</a> also helps create your own cartridges.</p>
