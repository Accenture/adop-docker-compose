Getting started with developing for ADOP is quite simple - if you can run the platform you can develop against it.

In the majority of cases you will want to develop a cartridge or platform extension which is simpler to do as there are more moving parts when developing the Core. It's also worth reading the [contributing](/adop-docker-compose/docs/contributing/) section if you plan on contributing back on GitHub - especially if you are embarking on an ambitious project.

There are development guides for each functional component:

* [Cartridges](/adop-docker-compose/docs/developing/cartridges/)
* [Platform Extensions](/adop-docker-compose/docs/developing/platform-extensions/)
* [Core](/adop-docker-compose/docs/developing/core/)
* [Command Line Interface](/adop-docker-compose/docs/developing/cli/)
