Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues, and should ideally be logged against their respective repository. If you aren't sure where something lives, raise it against the [main repository](https://github.com/Accenture/adop-docker-compose/issues) and someone can steer you in the correct direction.

When raising an issue please include the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe how to reproduce the problem in as many details as possible
    * Can the problem be reliably reproduced?
* Provide a specific example of the steps
* Describe the behaviour you saw after following the steps and what you think is wrong with it
* Explain the behaviour you expect to see
* Include screenshots and logs where applicable
* Include information regarding the environment you are working in
    * What is the commit ID for adop-docker-compose that you are using?
    * What is the name and version of the OS you are using?
