Platform extensions provide the ability to extend the Core and add new tools or extensions to existing tools. The general rule of thumb is that if itâ€™s not in the Core and it could be used by multiple cartridges, it is probably a platform extension.

Platform extensions are defined according to the [platform extension specification](https://github.com/Accenture/adop-platform-extension-specification) which can be used as a basis for [platform extension development](/adop-docker-compose/docs/developing/platform-extensions/).

## Platform Extension Collections
Platform extensions can be grouped together into collections so that related platform extensions can be loaded in one go.
